## About Time Doctor Project
Bluewater Health has been overwhelmed by the significant number of surgeries required in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company was forced to shut down all non-urgent surgeries for over 14 months, leading to the backlog they are facing now. Thankfully they were able to hire Time Doctor, a software company that has designed time-tracking and scheduling solutions for several industries. You and your colleagues have been hired as the newest group of interns for Time Doctor to work as part of the development team to build a surgery scheduling tool that the administration and hospital staff can use at Bluewater Health.
